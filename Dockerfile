##
# Dockerfile for the trading platform
#
# This Dockerfile sets up a minimal Ubuntu environment with Python and the
# MetaTrader5 Python package.  It assumes that the MetaTraderÂ 5 terminal
# executable will be mounted into the container at runtime via a volume
# mount.  The terminal itself is **not** downloaded or installed by this
# Dockerfile because MetaQuotes does not provide a native Linux version.  If
# running on Linux you can install MT5 under Wine and mount that directory
# into the container; on Windows you can mount the terminal directly.
